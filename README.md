# Octonions

Contains the Sage (an extension of Python) modules used in my undergraduate research into the embeddings of planar pointsets in orders of the composition algebras - i.e. the octonions and its subalgebras.

I highly recommend Sage (http://www.sagemath.org/) as a tool for computational algebra and number theory, though I recommend only using it on Unix based operating systems.
